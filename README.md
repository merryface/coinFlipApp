This is an App I created for a Youtube video, to allow folks who have never touched code to get their toes in the water. It is a code along project, where the focus is not to learn the specific tools, but instead to help them create a fully functional one page website with styling and interactivity in under an hour.

[You can watch the video here](https://youtu.be/3plIYH1t94s)

The video is a little rough around the edges, but it should be enough to encourage new people to learn how to code.
